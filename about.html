		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>This is a mock online library system developed for the Web Development II Assignment by Keith Chambers</p>
		<p>The system has the following functionality:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>User can log in or register a new account</li>
			<li>If the user is not logged in they will be refused access to the main page</li>
			<li>Logged in users can search for books by auther and/or title</li>
			<li>Search results will be limited to 5 per page and contain all stored information about the book</li>
			<li>Users will be able to see in the search results what whether a book has been reserved or not. If a book is unreserved the user may reserve it him/herself if they have not exceeded their borrow limit</li>
			<li>A logged in user may also see all the books they currently have reserved on the right side of the main page</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>For any questions use <a href="contact.html">this</a> contact link to get in touch.</p>
